    <p>Ever wanted to eat your tacos on a bun? Now you can with this recipe for taco burgers. The hamburger meat is seasoned with a taco packet before getting grilled and topped with cheese, sour cream, salsa, cilantro, tomato, avocado, and onion.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning</li>
        <li>5 slices pepper Jack cheese</li>
        <li>5 hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>¼ cup sour cream, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup salsa, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
        <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Mix ground beef and taco seasoning together in a bowl with your hands. Separate mixture into 5 equal portions. Form into patties.</li>
            <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill for 5 minutes. Flip, top with pepper Jack cheese slices, and continue to grill until no longer pink or to desired doneness, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a patty should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
