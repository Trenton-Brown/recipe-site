    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 poblano peppers, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup long-grain rice</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, cored and chopped</li>
        <li>½ lime, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped cilantro, divided</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen roasted corn (such as Trader Joe's®), thawed</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place poblano peppers, cut sides down, onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, about 6 minutes. Wrap peppers in the aluminum foil from the baking sheet. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 15 minutes. Remove and discard skins and seeds. Chop into bite-size pieces.</li>
            <li>Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in ground pork, chicken broth, rice, 1/2 the onion, taco seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Bake, covered, in the preheated oven until pork is no longer pink and rice is tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine the remaining onion, tomatoes, lime zest, lime juice, and 1 tablespoon cilantro in a small bowl. Season salsa with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir the roasted poblano peppers, remaining cilantro, and corn into the baked pork-rice dish. Sprinkle cheese blend on top; let stand until melted, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle the salsa on top.</li>
        </ol>
