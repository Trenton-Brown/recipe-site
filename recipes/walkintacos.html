    <p>These walking tacos are ready in 20 minutes and require no cleanup! Try switching up the chips and use Fritos, Cool Ranch Doritos, or Cheetos. Quick and easy to make, kids love it, and there is no cleanup. The meat can be made up in advance, so when it's time to eat, just heat up the meat and you are ready to go. Easy enough to eat in the car on the way to soccer practice on a busy night!</p>
